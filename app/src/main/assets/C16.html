int main()
{
    printf("size of short : %d\n",sizeof(short));
    printf("size of short int : %d\n",sizeof(short int));
    printf("size of signed short  : %d\n",sizeof(signed short));
    printf("size of signed short int  : %d\n",sizeof(signed short int));
    
    return 0;
}
</textarea>

<h3 id="header-list-menu">Output</h3>
<textarea readonly style="height:80px";>
size of short : 2 
size of short int : 2
