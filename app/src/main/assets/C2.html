<li>BCPL stands for Basic Combined Programming Language. Extension of CPL. Developed by Martin Richard in the University of Cambridge in 1969. It allows the direct access of memory.</li>
<li>B language was developed by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie in 1969.</li>
<li>C language was developed by Dennis Ritchie in 1972 at Bell Laboratories in the USA. The main aim of Dennis Ritchie to create C language is to develop a programming language to create a UNIX operating system.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="header-list-menu">ANSI C</h3>
<p>ANSI stands for American National Standard Institute.
</p>
<p>After 1972, different companies created their own version of C language so then there was a need to standardize the frame of C language, for this reason, ANSI creates a committee in 1988, the C is the standardize and the name was given to it is ANSI C ( C 89).
</p>
<p>
After that came, C 90 = C 89 + some new libraries + some keywords as like const, volatile, sign etc, and C 99 = C 90 + some new features.
