<h1>Difference between printf and puts</h1>
<p>In this tutorial we will learn what are the differences between printf and puts functions in c programming language?
</p>
<p>
Both functions are declared in stdio.h and used to send text/character stream to output stream (that will print on the standard output device).
</p>
<p>
But both are not same, their functionality, syntaxes and usages are different; basically they have two differences:
</p>


<ul>
<li>printf can print the value of mixed type of variables but puts canâ€™t print, puts has single parameter that is character array (character pointer).</li>
<li>printf prints whatever you provide, it may be text, text + values etc without adding new line after the text while puts add one more character that is new line character (\n) just after the text/character stream.</li>
</ul>

<p>
So basically, if we want to print the string either we can use printf or puts, but if we want to add new line after the string, we should use puts.

<h3 id="header-list-menu">printf</h3>

<p>
As we discussed in many posts that printf is used to print message/text/character stream along with the values of variables.
</p>
<h3 id="header-list-menu">puts</h3>

<p>
puts is used to print the string (character stream) on the output stream (that will print on the standard output device) with additional new line character (\n).
</p>
<b> Here is the synta</b>
<p> int puts(const char *text);</p>
<b> Here</b>
<ul>
<li>text is the character stream to be printed, it may be direct value within the double quotes or a character array variable.</li>
<li>Return type int - puts returns total number of printed characters excluding new line character (which adds automatically).</li>
</ul>


<b> Here are three variations of puts</b>

<textarea readonly style="height:30px";>
puts("Hello world!");
</textarea>

<textarea readonly style="height:40px";>
char msg[]="Hello world!";
puts(msg);
</textarea>

<textarea readonly style="height:30px";>
const char *msg="Hello world!";
puts(msg);
</textarea>
